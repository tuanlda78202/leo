## Code Standards

### Python Code Style

- **Formatter**: [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code formatting
- **Linter**: Ruff for code linting and import sorting
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for functions and classes

### TypeScript/React Code Style

- **ESLint**: For code linting
- **Prettier**: For code formatting (via package.json config)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled

### General Guidelines

- **Line Length**: Maximum 88 characters for Python, 100 for TypeScript
- **Imports**: Sort imports alphabetically and group them properly
- **Variables**: Use descriptive names, avoid abbreviations
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments explaining "why", not "what"

### Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Format code
make format-fix

# Fix linting issues
make lint-fix

# Check everything
make ci
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# BE tests
cd app/offline_sys && uv run pytest
cd app/online_sys && uv run pytest

# FE tests
cd app/online_sys/ui && npm test
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for new functions and classes
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Aim for good test coverage, but focus on quality over quantity

### Test Structure

```python
def test_function_name():
    # Arrange
    input_data = {...}

    # Act
    result = function_under_test(input_data)

    # Assert
    assert result == expected_result
```
