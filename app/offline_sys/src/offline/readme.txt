Clean Architecture emphasizes the division of an applicationâ€™s concerns, promoting scalability, testability, and maintainability. 
The architecture is organized into distinct layers: Presentation Layer, Application Layer, Domain Layer, and Infrastructure Layer. 
The Presentation Layer manages user interface and interactions
the Application Layer handles business logic,
the Domain Layer contains essential entities and business rules, 
and the Infrastructure Layer deals with technical details like databases, APIs, and external services.
